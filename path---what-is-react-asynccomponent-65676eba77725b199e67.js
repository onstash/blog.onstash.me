I did some digging on my own. Turns out, <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/0280e93b1152d37b6b784dffbd04088c4e2dda90/packages/react/src/ReactBaseClasses.js#L155">it</a> has a <code>prototype</code> called <code>unstable_isAsyncReactComponent</code> which indicates that this is unstable API and might change in the future.</p>\n<p>I didn’t understand what it was intended for. I wasn’t and am not sure what it is and how &#x26; where it could be used.

I was hoping for one of two things -  a detailed StackOverflow answer that’s blurry at 3am or a Medium / blog post that’s hopefully not clickbait. Turns out those weren’t the droids I was looking for. So I opened up a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/47914273/3992797">question</a> on StackOverflow myself hoping for answers from people who know more about React’s source.</p>',frontmatter:{title:"What is React.AsyncComponent?",date:"December 24, 2017",description:"Does anybody know what that is?",category:null,next:"event-bubbling-in-javascript",previous:"why-footyfollowr"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/what-is-react-asynccomponent/"}}}});
