2017 started off on a noisy note thanks to people blasting a LOT of crackers. So the backstreet dogs decided to howl before their standard 3AM standup meeting. And like any other fellow who reviews his year, I happened to go through *ups* and *downs* & experience *positive* and *negative* things. But unlike other fellows, I am going to label them as *lessons learnt*.

### Play time

To start things off in 2017, I finally got to act in a play that was 80 minutes long. After being involved with college theater in various capacities since 2013, I went up on stage for the very first time in Bangalore under the banner of CreaShakthi, a prominent theater group in Madras. All the credits go to my friends who trained me. In spite of logistical and people issues, we managed to practice a lot before the play. In the end, we had a fantastic show in Jagriti Theater, Whitefield on February 18th. The play was about 5 people in a line and their struggles of coming first in it. We also put up a show in Madras on March 24th.

### Musings

This year has been quite eventful as a developer -

- Learnt the hard way - **Code is written for other humans to read. With enough documentation and context, if people are unable to understand what you have tried to express in your code, you have failed.**

- **Started working with React, Webpack and SASS**
    Coming from a (non-Javascript) Python background, I found the learning curve for React to be steep. Especially wrapping around the concepts of UI as (almost) pure functions. Learning Webpack was a hard challenge, initially. I gave up in February until I tried again in July for one of my side projects. SASS was fun to learn. It enabled writing maintainable code.

- **Started working with React Native**
    The main challenge of React Native is related to the initial setup of Android SDKs and XCode, a few months later. Since React Native is a framework based on React, it was not a steep learning curve as I expected. For people wondering if choosing React Native would speed things up development wise - it **totally** depends on the people involved.

- **Learnt about the whole lifecycle of product development**
    It starts with discussing what _features_ are required in said product. After said heated discussions it formally becomes a _product requirements document_ which becomes my _source of truth_. Sometime *design mocks* also come through to you. After that it's all about *planning*, *project structuring*, *chunking down objectives* into *tasks with deadlines*, *setting a deadline*, *being accountable with regular updates to whoever you're reporting to* and *delivering it before or on agreed delivery date*.

- **Launched my side project web app called FootyFollowr**
    I finally got around to solve a problem I faced ever since I graduated in 2015 - following football leagues without the fuss. This [post](/why-footyfollower) explains it better.

-  Lesson learnt - **If you're planning on launching an idea of yours, launch a functional version first, get critical feedback and iterate on it. Chasing perfection without launching or iterating on a lauched version is useless.**
    This applies to any idea - it may be a side project or it might related to work.

-  **Code reviews are useful**
    Code reviews are useful if the people involved are objective in their criticisms. Otherwise it's just pain and frustration. Especially if you're dealing with someone obsessed with single quotes, commit squashing and incomprehensible commit messages that are of no use to anybody reading it.

- **Burning out is common**
    If you don't know what a burnout is, Psychology Today has succintly explained it [here](https://www.psychologytoday.com/basics/burnout). Usually taking a break and/or spending time with family helps you get out of one. But if the issue you're dealing with is something deeper, then you have to address the issue before taking any break that'd be useful. If the issue is related to people who are incapable to or won't address the issue, fortunately you're not alone. Ignore anyone who suggests allopathic "solutions" to your problem in the pretext of solving it.

- **Context switching is hard**
    If you're not sure what I am talking about read [this comic](http://i.imgur.com/3uyRWGJ.jpg). If you're still unsure, please read the reddit [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/2rmir6/why_developers_hate_being_interrupted/) associated with said comic and this [article](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2001/02/12/human-task-switches-considered-harmful/) by Joel Spolsky. Non-technical folks won't get the pain of context switching. Heck they think it's a joke.

-   **Blogging is fun and useful**
    After years of contemplation, I have started to blog mostly about my musings as developer [here](https://goo.gl/BPqZdZ). It is fun and useful because I am documenting things that I encounter.

### Hoomans

- First of all **study** Dale Carnegie's **How to win friends and influence people**, remember his teachings and apply it when dealing with hoomans. This is a note to self.

- You're dealing with beings of emotion. Objectivity won't work every time. Try throwing objectivity at your girlfriend when she's pissed off at you for emotional reasons.

- Communicate in a crisp and concise manner devoid of any tones.

- Be nice to hoomans. Saying "hello", "thank you" etc goes a long way.

- Try not to be a dick to others because one day someone will definitely be a dick to you and I don't think you'll like it.

- Avoid or minimize contact with hoomans who think the world revovles around them.

- When you're objectively asking someone and they dodge answering it by talking about the manner in which you asked or wielding their "authority" card or they answer it with knee-jerk (read "me-jerk") replies, congratulations are finally in order. You're officially dealing with a kid having fragile ego bubbles. WAAH WAAH WAAH!

- Try not to label hoomans and force the labeling on others by constantly talking about it. That's basically force-feeding your bias onto others.

- When giving objective feedback, try to be nice and try hard not to shit on them and their work in the pretext of "giving objective feedback". Or if you plan to do the latter, at least give them the oppurtunity for them to gift a basket of freshly generated excreta as feedback to your work.

- There are a lot of people narrativizing their way through everyday life. Read this [Buzzfeed longread](https://www.buzzfeed.com/annehelenpetersen/ten-long-years-of-trying-to-make-armie-hammer-happen?utm_term=.jcaxlpzvO#.odKKQmYEe) (I promise it's neither an oxymoron nor a listicle) if you're unsure of what I am talking about.

### Books

I'll be honest here. I am not an avid reader like those who read 3000 books a year while Facebooking and/or Instgramming and/or and/or Instagram-story-ing and/or Whatsapp-story-ing quotes from them. TN board would have built a statue for you if you were a student and topped their results by being the 400th "1st rank in state" person. I managed to read 3 books this year - _Outliers_ by _Malcom Gladwell_, _The Defining Decade_ by _Meg Ryan_ and _How to win friends and influence people_ by Dale Carnegie. As you observed from the hoomans section, I am not strong at dealing with hoomans. The important thing about reading non-fiction books is to understand, analyze and apply them in your life. There's no point in throwing stones at a dog & getting bit by it when the author clearly states that doing the same will get you bit and having an epiphany about what the author actually said, 5 years later.

### Adulting

- After my Dell Inspiron n5110 died of a heart attack in the maternal side, I decided to buy a Macbook Pro via my sister. There was no objective reason why other laptops with similar functionalities couldn't make the cut or why this laptop was the best there is. I wanted to buy it because it was part of my bucket list.

- By finally agreeing with my sister and a wise old acquaintance of mine, I got a credit card. People who cared enough warned me about credit card debt and how to spend in a planned and careful manner. So far, I have not used my credit card other than the EMI that I pay every month for buying OnePlus 5 and buying monthly groceries.

- Started cooking after looking at the long term benefits of it

As a footnote, I would like to thank everybody involved in the past year. You know who you're.

**May The Force Live Long and Prosper With You!**
